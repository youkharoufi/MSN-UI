## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve MSN-UI`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

# MSN

MSN is a chat application in which you can as a user send friend requests, accept or deny them, and chat with your friends via a SignalR based chat.

## Installation
To start using the app, you first have to open a terminal and enter : 

```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

Then run :

```
npm start
```

This is a frontend application, which means that it works in pair with the MSN-API backend API. You can find MSN-API in my repositories.

## Usage

You can see that there are seed users already to help you use the app without having to register with your actual email address.
If you do choose to register with your email address, you will receive a confirmation email with a link that you will have
to click in order to use the app.

## Rules

You can only chat once you have sent an invitation (or friend request) and accepted it with the receiving user. You can connect to all 3 
of the seeded users by entering their usernames (Youssef, Henry and Estelle). As for the password, it is the same for all 3 users : 1234

Example : 

```
username:Henry
password:1234
```

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
